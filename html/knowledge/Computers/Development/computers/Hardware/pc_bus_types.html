      <h1>Bus Types</h1>
      <h2>ISA</h2>
      <!-- These are broken links <img border="0" src="images/isaslot.jpg" width="565" height="39"> -->
      <p>
      Industry Standard Architechture. A 16-bit slot, this is the oldest of
      the three bus types. It is typically still found in nearly every
      computer sold today.Generally used for modems and most sound cards.
   </h3>
   <h2>VLB</h2>
   <!-- These are broken links <img border="0" src="images/vesaslot.jpg" width="915" height="39"> -->
   <p>
        VESA Local Bus. A 32-bit slot, this originated in and was designed for
        486 systems Generally used by video cards and hard drive controllers
        Cards in these slots are not plug-n-play.
      </p>
      <h2>PCI</h2>
      <!-- These are broken links <img border="0" src="images/pcislot.jpg" width="398" height="39"> -->
      <p>
        Peripheral Component Interface. Also a 32-bit slot, is mainly found in
        Pentium Class systems, but also can be found on some 486 systems.
        Generally used by IDE/SCSI controllers, video cards, network cards,
        video capture boards, and some sound cards.
      </p>
      <h2>AGP</h2>
      
      <!-- These are broken links <img border="0" src="images/agpslot.jpg" width="398" height="39"> -->
      <p>
        Accelerated Graphics Port. This newest bus was designed to be used
        exclusively by the display adapter. Currently, only Intel's 440LX
        chipset (found in Pentium II motherboards) supports AGP. Upon the
        release of next generation operating systems (Windows98, Windows NT
        5.0), the performance of AGP will increase at its importance will be
        quite obvious.
