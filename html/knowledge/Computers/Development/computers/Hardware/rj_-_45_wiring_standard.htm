<h3>Telephone Cable</h3>Phone cable generally contains two pairs of wires, for 
two phone lines. The first pair is green and red; the second is black and 
yellow. The way you remember this is that there are two holidays: Christmas and 
Halloween. (I apologize if this is a US-centric mnemonic. I encourage everyone 
around the world to celebrate Halloween.) This set of colors is standardized for 
stranded wires (where each &quot;wire&quot; consists of about 20 little tiny wires that 
stick in your fingers and hurt like hell if you aren't careful.) For solid 
wires, the colors defined below for Ethernet are used; pair 1 is 
White/Blue+Blue, pair 2 is White/Orange+Orange. <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; 
<h4>RJ-12 Plug Wiring</h4><img align="left" src="images/rj11.gif" WIDTH="202" HEIGHT="216"> <br>This is the wiring 
for the plug side of an RJ-12 connector. Can you say &quot;BRGY&quot;? (Think about cheap 
red wine; I know I do.) The diagram is shown with the &quot;hook&quot; - the little thing 
you press on to get the plug out - underneath. RJ-11 sockets always have the 
colors indicated on the terminals. 
<p>&nbsp;Note that the connector on the <i>other end</i> of an RJ-11 connector 
is wired in <b>reverse</b> order. That is, if you stretch the cable out flat, 
the Black wire stays on the left all the way to the other end, including through 
the connector with the hook oriented down also. <br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Note: The only difference between RJ-11, RJ-12 and RJ-13 is the corresponding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
number of pairs of connectors.

<h3>T-568B Color Code for RJ-45 Plug</h3>Eight-conductor data cable contains 4 
pairs of wires. Each pair consists of a solid (or predominantly) colored wire 
and a white wire with a stripe of the same color. The pairs are twisted 
together. To maintain reliability on Ethernet, you should not untwist them any 
more than necessary (like about 1 cm). 
<p><img align="left" src="images/rj45.gif" WIDTH="241" HEIGHT="225"> <br>There are two wiring standards for these cables, called &quot;T-568A&quot; 
and T-568B&quot; They differ only in connection sequence, not in use of the various 
colors. The illustration shown is for T-568B. The pairs designated for 10BaseT 
Ethernet are Orange and Green. The other two pairs, Brown and Blue, can be used 
for a second Ethernet line or for phone connections. 
<p>&nbsp;Note that the Blue pair is on the center pins and conveniently 
corresponds to the Red and Green pair in a normal phone line. The connections 
shown are specifically for an RJ45 plug (the thing on the end of the wire). The 
wall jack may be wired in a different sequence because the wires are actually 
crossed inside the jack. The jack should either come with a wiring diagram or at 
least designate pin numbers that you can match up to the color code below. 
<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; 
<p><b>Pin Number Designations</b> <br>There are pin number designations for each 
color in T568B as well. The pin designations are as follows: <!--mstheme--></font><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; Color Codes for T568B

8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; brn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4</pre><!--mstheme--><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">Note 
that the odd pin numbers are always the white with stripe color.

<h3>T-568B Color Code for RJ-45 Crossover</h3>Eight-conductor data cable contains 4 
pairs of wires. Each pair consists of a solid (or predominantly) colored wire 
and a white wire with a stripe of the same color. The pairs are twisted 
together. To maintain reliability on Ethernet, you should not untwist them any 
more than necessary (like about 1 cm).
