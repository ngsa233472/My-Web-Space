        <p>In 1987, professors Garth Gibson, Randy Katz, and
        David Patterson at the University of California outlined
        6 RAID levels.&nbsp; These formally defined RAID levels
        are a family of techniques for managing a suite of disk
        drives so that reliability, data availability, and
        performance are all maximized for a wide variety of
        applications.&nbsp; Each RAID level defines how the RAID
        will function.&nbsp; The following Table Summarizes RAID
        levels 0 though 5.&nbsp; <br>

                sequentially on each drive in the system.&nbsp;
                RAID level 0 has no redundancy.&nbsp; If one
                drive fails, all data stored on the system
                becomes unusable.&nbsp; Due to its lack of fault
                tolerance, RAID level 0 is best suited for high
                performance applications that do not require data
                protection.&nbsp;<!--mstheme--></font></td>

                Use of a mirror drive virtually eliminates system
                interruption due to drive failure.&nbsp; Data is
                duplicated (in pairs) for storage on each
                drive.&nbsp; The use of dual drives more than
                doubles the cost of the storage unit.&nbsp; RAID
                level 1 provides fair read performance but much
                slower write performance since it must write to

                error correcting code or parity data.&nbsp; RAID
                2 is typically used for large computer systems
                due to the robustness of its design.<!--mstheme--></font></td>

                similar to RAID level 2 but better suited to
                microcomputers.&nbsp; In a typical RAID level 3
                system only one parity drive is used for all data
                drives.&nbsp; Interleaving of data occurs at a
                predefined logical size (bit, byte, block, or
                other unit).&nbsp; Each drive holds a portion of
                the data.&nbsp; The synchronized spindles yield
                high data transfer rates.&nbsp; This makes RAID
                level 3 ideal for high performance systems, such
                as image processing, where speed and accuracy are

                Eliminating the parity drive allows the system to
                perform multiple read and write functions at the
                same time.&nbsp; This increases the virtual
                transfer rate by one-half the number of drives in

        While the RAID levels are as different as the user
        communities that they are designed to serve, they do
        share some common characteristics.&nbsp; With the
        exception of RAID level 0, a simple non-redundant disk
        array, these RAID levels all provide no loss of data due
        to individual disk failure and continuous operation
        during the downtime of a failed disk.&nbsp; In the event
        of a failed disk drive, RAID systems notify the operator
        of the failure and continue to operate by using the
        redundantly stored information to respond to user data
        requests.&nbsp; Upon replacement of the failed disk, the
        RAID system will automatically and transparently use the
        redundant data stored on the array to reconstruct the
        data previously stored on the failed disk.&nbsp; </p>
        <h3>Which Is The Right Raid Level?&nbsp;</h3>
        <p>The answer, of course, is it depends on the
        application.&nbsp; RAID Level 3 offers high transfer
        rates, and is ideal for large blocks of data where speed
        is of importance.&nbsp; Computer Aided Design, Graphics,
        Scientific Computing, Image and Multimedia applications
        are all good examples.&nbsp; RAID Level 5 arrays offer
        high I/O transaction rates, and are ideal for on-line
        transaction processing (OLTP) applications, such as for
        banks, insurance companies, hospitals, and all manner of
        office environments.&nbsp; These applications typically
        perform large numbers of concurrent requests, each of
        which makes a small number of disk accesses.&nbsp; Both
        RAID Levels 3 and 5 offer a good level of fault tolerance
        and overall system reliability at a reasonable cost for
        redundancy overhead.&nbsp; If cost and performance are of
        significantly less importance than fault tolerance and
        reliability, then a RAID Level 1 solution may be an
        appropriate choice.&nbsp; Conversely, if&nbsp; data rate
        performance, fault tolerance and reliability are not an
        important, then RAID Level 0 may be a suitable choice.
        Transaction processing systems are usually measured by
        their throughput in transactions per second (often
        specified as I/Os per second), rather than by the service
        time for individual transactions.&nbsp; Many engineering
        and office applications consist of programs that access
        large numbers of small files, such as the source files
        for a program or the font libraries for a laser printer.

        sense, depending upon what you are trying to do:&nbsp; <br>
