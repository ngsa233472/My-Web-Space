        Java provides a rich set of operators to manipulate variables. We can
        divide all the Java operators into the following groups:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><p>Arithmetic Operators</p></li>
        <li><p>Relational Operators</p></li>

        <li><p>Logical Operators</p></li>
        <li><p>Assignment Operators</p></li>
        <li><p>Misc Operators</p></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>The Arithmetic Operators:</h2>
      <p>
        Arithmetic operators are used in mathematical expressions in the same
        way that they are used in algebra. The following table lists the
        arithmetic operators:
      </p>
      <p>Assume integer variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then:</p>

      <h2>The Bitwise Operators:</h2>
      <p>
        Java defines several bitwise operators which can be applied to the
        integer types, long, int, short, char, and byte.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit by bit operation. Assume
        if a = 60; and b = 13; Now in binary format they will be as follows:
      </p>
      <p>a = 0011 1100</p>
      <p>b = 0000 1101</p>
      <p>-----------------</p>
      <p>a&amp;b = 0000 1100</p>
      <p>a|b = 0011 1101</p>
      <p>a^b = 0011 0001</p>
      <p>~a&nbsp; = 1100 0011</p>

      <h2>Misc Operators</h2>
      <p>There are few other operators supported by Java Language.</p>
      <h2>Conditional Operator ( ? : ):</h2>
      <p>
        Conditional operator is also known as the ternary operator. This
        operator consists of three operands and is used to evaluate boolean
        expressions. The goal of the operator is to decide which value should be
        assigned to the variable. The operator is written as :
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
variable x = (expression) ? value if true : value if false
</pre
      >
      <p>Following is the example:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
public class Test {

   public static void main(String args[]){
      int a , b;
      a = 10;
      b = (a == 1) ? 20: 30;
      System.out.println( "Value of b is : " +  b );

      b = (a == 10) ? 20: 30;
      System.out.println( "Value of b is : " + b );
   }
}
</pre
      >
      <p>This would produce following result:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
Value of b is : 30
Value of b is : 20
</pre
      >
      <h2>instanceOf Operator:</h2>
      <p>
        This operator is used only for object reference variables. The operator
        checks whether the object is of a particular type(class type or
        interface type). instanceOf operator is wriiten as:
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
( Object reference variable ) instanceOf  (class/interface type)
</pre
      >
      <p>
        If the object referred by the variable on the left side of the operator
        passes the IS-A check for the class/interface type on the right side
        then the result will be true. Following is the example:
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
String name = = 'James';
boolean result = name instanceOf String;  
// This will return true since name is type of String
</pre
      >
      <p>
        This operator will still return true if the object being compared is the
        assignment compatible with the type on the right. Following is one more
        example:
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
class Vehicle {}

public class Car extends Vehicle {
   public static void main(String args[]){
      Vehicle a = new Car();
      boolean result =  a instanceof Car;
      System.out.println( result);
   }
}
</pre
      >
      <p>This would produce following result:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
true
</pre
      >
      <h2>Precedence of Java Operators:</h2>
      <p>
        Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression.
        This affects how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have
        higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator
        has higher precedence than the addition operator:
      </p>
      <p>
        For example x = 7 + 3 * 2; Here x is assigned 13, not 20 because
        operator * has higher precedenace than + so it first get multiplied with
        3*2 and then adds into 7.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the
        table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression,
        higher precedenace operators will be evaluated first.

      <h2>What is Next ?</h2>
      <p>
        Next chapter would explain about loop control in Java programming. The
        chapter will describe various types of loops and how these loops can be
        used in Java program development and for what purposes they are being
        used.
