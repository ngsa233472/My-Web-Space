      <p>
        Prior to Java 2, Java provided ad hoc classes such as
        <b>Dictionary, Vector, Stack</b>, and <b>Properties</b> to store and
        manipulate groups of objects. Although these classes were quite useful,
        they lacked a central, unifying theme. Thus, the way that you used
        Vector was different from the way that you used Properties.
      </p>
      <p>The collections framework was designed to meet several goals.</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          <p>
            The framework had to be high-performance. The implementations for
            the fundamental collections (dynamic arrays, linked lists, trees,
            and hash tables) are highly efficient.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The framework had to allow different types of collections to work in
            a similar manner and with a high degree of interoperability.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Extending and/or adapting a collection had to be easy.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Toward this end, the entire collections framework is designed around a
        set of standard interfaces. Several standard implementations such as
        <b>LinkedList, HashSet,</b> and <b>TreeSet</b>, of these interfaces are
        provided that you may use as-is and you may also implement your own
        collection, if you choose.
      </p>
      <p>
        A collections framework is a unified architecture for representing and
        manipulating collections. All collections frameworks contain the
        following:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Interfaces:</b> These are abstract data types that represent
            collections. Interfaces allow collections to be manipulated
            independently of the details of their representation. In
            object-oriented languages, interfaces generally form a hierarchy.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Implementations i.e. Classes:</b> These are the concrete
            implementations of the collection interfaces. In essence, they are
            reusable data structures.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Algorithms:</b> These are the methods that perform useful
            computations, such as searching and sorting, on objects that
            implement collection interfaces. The algorithms are said to be
            polymorphic: that is, the same method can be used on many different
            implementations of the appropriate collection interface.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In addition to collections, the framework defines several map interfaces
        and classes. Maps store key/value pairs. Although maps are not
        <i>collections</i> in the proper use of the term, but they are fully
        integrated with collections.
      </p>
      <h2>The Collection Interfaces:</h2>
      <p>
        The collections framework defines several interfaces. This section
        provides an overview of each interface:

            objects. This legacy interface has been superceded by Iterator.

      <h2>The Collection Classes:</h2>
      <p>
        Java provides a set of standard collection classes that implement
        Collection interfaces. Some of the classes provide full implementations
        that can be used as-is and others are abstract class, providing skeletal
        implementations that are used as starting points for creating concrete
        collections.
      </p>
      <p>
        The standard collection classes are summarized in the following table:

      <h2>The Collection Algorithms:</h2>
      <p>
        The collections framework defines several algorithms that can be applied
        to collections and maps. These algorithms are defined as static methods
        within the Collections class.
      </p>
      <p>
        Several of the methods can throw a <b>ClassCastException</b>, which
        occurs when an attempt is made to compare incompatible types, or an
        <b>UnsupportedOperationException</b>, which occurs when an attempt is
        made to modify an unmodifiable collection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Collections defines three static variables: EMPTY_SET, EMPTY_LIST, and
        EMPTY_MAP. All are immutable.
      </p>

      <h2>How to use an Iterator ?</h2>
      <p>
        Often, you will want to cycle through the elements in a collection. For
        example, you might want to display each element.
      </p>
      <p>
        The easiest way to do this is to employ an iterator, which is an object
        that implements either the Iterator or the ListIterator interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        Iterator enables you to cycle through a collection, obtaining or
        removing elements. ListIterator extends Iterator to allow bidirectional
        traversal of a list, and the modification of elements.
      </p>

      <h2>How to use an Comparator ?</h2>
      <p>
        Both TreeSet and TreeMap store elements in sorted order. However, it is
        the comparator that defines precisely what <i>sorted order</i> means.
      </p>
      <p>
        This interface lets us sort a given collection any number of different
        ways. Also this interface can be used to sort any instances of any
        class.(even classes we cannot modify).

      <h2>Summary:</h2>
      <p>
        The Java collections framework gives the programmer access to
        prepackaged data structures as well as to algorithms for manipulating
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        A collection is an object that can hold references to other objects. The
        collection interfaces declare the operations that can be performed on
        each type of collection.
      </p>
      <p>
        The classes and interfaces of the collections framework are in package
        java.util.
