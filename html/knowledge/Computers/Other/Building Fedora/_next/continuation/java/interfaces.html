      <p>
        An interface is a collection of abstract methods. A class implements an
        interface, thereby inheriting the abstract methods of the interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        An interface is not a class. Writing an interface is similar to writing
        a class, but they are two different concepts. A class describes the
        attributes and behaviors of an object. An interface contains behaviors
        that a class implements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless the class that implements the interface is abstract, all the
        methods of the interface need to be defined in the class.
      </p>
      <p>An interface is similar to a class in the following ways:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><p>An interface can contain any number of methods.</p></li>
        <li>
          <p>
            An interface is written in a file with a <b>.java</b> extension,
            with the name of the interface matching the name of the file.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The bytecode of an interface appears in a <b>.class</b> file.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Interfaces appear in packages, and their corresponding bytecode file
            must be in a directory structure that matches the package name.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        However, an interface is different from a class in several ways,
        including:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          <p>
            You cannot instantiate an interface.
            <li><p>An interface does not contain any constructors.</p></li>
            <li><p>All of the methods in an interface are abstract.</p></li>
            <li>
              <p>
                An interface cannot contain instance fields. The only fields
                that can appear in an interface must be declared both static and
                final.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                An interface is not extended by a class; it is implemented by a
                class.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><p>An interface can extend multiple interfaces.</p></li>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Declaring Interfaces:</h2>
      <p>
        The <b>interface</b> keyword is used to declare an interface. Here is a
        simple example to declare an interface:
      </p>
      <h2>Example:</h2>
      <p>Let us look at an example that depicts encapsulation:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
/* File name : NameOfInterface.java */
import java.lang.*;
//Any number of import statements

public interface NameOfInterface
{
   //Any number of final, static fields
   //Any number of abstract method declarations\
}
</pre
      >
      <p>Interfaces have the following properties:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          <p>
            An interface is implicitly abstract. You do not need to use the
            <b>abstract</b> keyword when declaring an interface.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Each method in an interface is also implicitly abstract, so the
            abstract keyword is not needed.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Methods in an interface are implicitly public.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Example:</h2>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
/* File name : Animal.java */
interface Animal {

   public void eat();
   public void travel();
}
</pre
      >
      <h2>Implementing Interfaces:</h2>
      <p>
        When a class implements an interface, you can think of the class as
        signing a contract, agreeing to perform the specific behaviors of the
        interface. If a class does not perform all the behaviors of the
        interface, the class must declare itself as abstract.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aclass uses the <b>implements</b> keyword to implement an interface. The
        implements keyword appears in the class declaration following the
        extends portion of the declaration.
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
/* File name : MammalInt.java */
public class MammalInt implements Animal{

   public void eat(){
      System.out.println("Mammal eats");
   }

   public void travel(){
      System.out.println("Mammal travels");
   } 

   public int noOfLegs(){
      return 0;
   }

   public static void main(String args[]){
      MammalInt m = new MammalInt();
      m.eat();
      m.travel();
   }
} 
</pre
      >
      <p>This would produce following result:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
Mammal eats
Mammal travels
</pre
      >
      <p>
        When overriding methods defined in interfaces there are several rules to
        be followed:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          <p>
            Checked exceptions should not be declared on implementation methods
            other than the ones declared by the interface method or subclasses
            of those declared by the interface method.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The signature of the interface method and the same return type or
            subtype should be maintained when overriding the methods.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            An implementation class itself can be abstract and if so interface
            methods need not be implemented.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>When implementation interfaces there are several rules:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><p>A class can implement more than one interface at a time.</p></li>
        <li>
          <p>
            A class can extend only one class, but implement many interface.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            An interface can extend another interface, similarly to the way that
            a class can extend another class.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Extending Interfaces:</h2>
      <p>
        An interface can extend another interface, similarly to the way that a
        class can extend another class. The <b>extends</b> keyword is used to
        extend an interface, and the child interface inherits the methods of the
        parent interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following Sports interface is extended by Hockey and Football
        interfaces.
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
//Filename: Sports.java
public interface Sports
{
   public void setHomeTeam(String name);
   public void setVisitingTeam(String name);
}

//Filename: Football.java
public interface Football extends Sports
{
   public void homeTeamScored(int points);
   public void visitingTeamScored(int points);
   public void endOfQuarter(int quarter);
}

//Filename: Hockey.java
public interface Hockey extends Sports
{
   public void homeGoalScored();
   public void visitingGoalScored();
   public void endOfPeriod(int period);
   public void overtimePeriod(int ot);
}
</pre
      >
      <p>
        The Hockey interface has four methods, but it inherits two from Sports;
        thus, a class that implements Hockey needs to implement all six methods.
        Similarly, a class that implements Football needs to define the three
        methods from Football and the two methods from Sports.
      </p>
      <h2>Extending Multiple Interfaces:</h2>
      <p>
        A Java class can only extend one parent class. Multiple inheritance is
        not allowed. Interfaces are not classes, however, and an interface can
        extend more than one parent interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        The extends keyword is used once, and the parent interfaces are declared
        in a comma-separated list.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if the Hockey interface extended both Sports and Event, it
        would be declared as:
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
public interface Hockey extends Sports, Event
</pre
      >
      <h2>Tagging Interfaces:</h2>
      <p>
        The most common use of extending interfaces occurs when the parent
        interface does not contain any methods. For example, the MouseListener
        interface in the java.awt.event package extended
        java.util.EventListener, which is defined as:
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
package java.util;
public interface EventListener
{}
</pre
      >
      <p>
        An interface with no methods in it is referred to as a
        <b>tagging</b> interface. There are two basic design purposes of tagging
        interfaces:
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Creates a common parent:</b> As with the EventListener interface,
        which is extended by dozens of other interfaces in the Java API, you can
        use a tagging interface to create a common parent among a group of
        interfaces. For example, when an interface extends EventListener, the
        JVM knows that this particular interface is going to be used in an event
        delegation scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Adds a data type to a class:</b> This situation is where the term
        tagging comes from. A class that implements a tagging interface does not
        need to define any methods (since the interface does not have any), but
        the class becomes an interface type through polymorphism.
