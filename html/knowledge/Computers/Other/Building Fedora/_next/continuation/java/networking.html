        The term <i>network programming</i> refers to writing programs that
        execute across multiple devices (computers), in which the devices are
        all connected to each other using a network.
      </p>
      <p>
        The java.net package of the J2SE APIs contains a collection of classes
        and interfaces that provide the low-level communication details,
        allowing you to write programs that focus on solving the problem at
        hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        The java.net package provides support for the two common network
        protocols:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>TCP:</b> TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol, which
            allows for reliable communication between two applications. TCP is
            typically used over the Internet Protocol, which is referred to as
            TCP/IP.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>UDP:</b> UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol, a connection-less
            protocol that allows for packets of data to be transmitted between
            applications.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Socket Programming:</h2>
      <p>
        Sockets provide the communication mechanism between two computers using
        TCP. A client program creates a socket on its end of the communication
        and attempts to connect that socket to a server.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the connection is made, the server creates a socket object on its
        end of the communication. The client and server can now communicate by
        writing to and reading from the socket.
      </p>
      <p>
        The java.net.Socket class represents a socket, and the
        java.net.ServerSocket class provides a mechanism for the server program
        to listen for clients and establish connections with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following steps occur when establishing a TCP connection between two
        computers using sockets:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          <p>
            The server instantiates a ServerSocket object, denoting which port
            number communication is to occur on.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The server invokes the accept() method of the ServerSocket class.
            This method waits until a client connects to the server on the given
            port.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            After the server is waiting, a client instantiates a Socket object,
            specifying the server name and port number to connect to.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The constructor of the Socket class attempts to connect the client
            to the specified server and port number. If communication is
            established, the client now has a Socket object capable of
            communicating with the server.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            On the server side, the accept() method returns a reference to a new
            socket on the server that is connected to the client's socket.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        After the connections are established, communication can occur using I/O
        streams. Each socket has both an OutputStream and an InputStream. The
        client's OutputStream is connected to the server's InputStream, and the
        client's InputStream is connected to the server's OutputStream.
      </p>
      <p>
        TCP is a twoway communication protocol, so data can be sent across both
        streams at the same time. There are following usefull classes providing
        complete set of methods to implement sockets.
      </p>
      <h2>ServerSocket Class Methods:</h2>
      <p>
        The <b>java.net.ServerSocket</b> class is used by server applications to
        obtain a port and listen for client requests
      </p>
      <p>The ServerSocket class has four constructors:</p>
      <table class="src">
        <tr>
          <th>SN</th>
          <th>Methods with Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>
            <b>public ServerSocket(int port) throws IOException</b
            ><br />Attempts to create a server socket bound to the specified
            port. An exception occurs if the port is already bound by another
            application.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>
            <b>public ServerSocket(int port, int backlog) throws IOException</b
            ><br />Similar to the previous constructor, the backlog parameter
            specifies how many incoming clients to store in a wait queue.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>3</td>
          <td>
            <b
              >public ServerSocket(int port, int backlog, InetAddress address)
              throws IOException</b
            ><br />Similar to the previous constructor, the InetAddress
            parameter specifies the local IP address to bind to. The InetAddress
            is used for servers that may have multiple IP addresses, allowing
            the server to specify which of its IP addresses to accept client
            requests on
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>4</td>
          <td>
            <b>public ServerSocket() throws IOException</b><br />Creates an
            unbound server socket. When using this constructor, use the bind()
            method when you are ready to bind the server socket
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        If the ServerSocket constructor does not throw an exception, it means
        that your application has successfully bound to the specified port and
        is ready for client requests.
      </p>
      <p>Here are some of the common methods of the ServerSocket class:</p>
      <table class="src">
        <tr>
          <th>SN</th>
          <th>Methods with Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>
            <b>public int getLocalPort()</b><br />Returns the port that the
            server socket is listening on. This method is useful if you passed
            in 0 as the port number in a constructor and let the server find a
            port for you.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>
            <b>public Socket accept() throws IOException</b><br />Waits for an
            incoming client. This method blocks until either a client connects
            to the server on the specified port or the socket times out,
            assuming that the time-out value has been set using the
            setSoTimeout() method. Otherwise, this method blocks indefinitely
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>3</td>
          <td>
            <b>public void setSoTimeout(int timeout)</b><br />Sets the time-out
            value for how long the server socket waits for a client during the
            accept().
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>4</td>
          <td>
            <b>public void bind(SocketAddress host, int backlog)</b><br />Binds
            the socket to the specified server and port in the SocketAddress
            object. Use this method if you instantiated the ServerSocket using
            the no-argument constructor.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        When the ServerSocket invokes accept(), the method does not return until
        a client connects. After a client does connect, the ServerSocket creates
        a new Socket on an unspecified port and returns a reference to this new
        Socket. A TCP connection now exists between the client and server, and
        communication can begin.
      </p>
      <h2>Socket Class Methods:</h2>
      <p>
        The <b>java.net.Socket</b> class represents the socket that both the
        client and server use to communicate with each other. The client obtains
        a Socket object by instantiating one, whereas the server obtains a
        Socket object from the return value of the accept() method.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Socket class has five constructors that a client uses to connect to
        a server:
      </p>
      <table class="src">
        <tr>
          <th>SN</th>
          <th>Methods with Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>
            <b
              >public Socket(String host, int port) throws UnknownHostException,
              IOException.</b
            ><br />This method attempts to connect to the specified server at
            the specified port. If this constructor does not throw an exception,
            the connection is successful and the client is connected to the
            server.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>
            <b>public Socket(InetAddress host, int port) throws IOException</b
            ><br />This method is identical to the previous constructor, except
            that the host is denoted by an InetAddress object.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>3</td>
          <td>

              int localPort) throws IOException.</b

            the local host at the specified address and port.

            ><br />This method is identical to the previous constructor, except
            that the host is denoted by an InetAddress object instead of a
            String

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>5</td>
          <td>
            <b>public Socket()</b><br />Creates an unconnected socket. Use the

          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        When the Socket constructor returns, it does not simply instantiate a
        Socket object but it actually attempts to connect to the specified
        server and port.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some methods of interest in the Socket class are listed here. Notice
        that both the client and server have a Socket object, so these methods
        can be invoked by both the client and server.
