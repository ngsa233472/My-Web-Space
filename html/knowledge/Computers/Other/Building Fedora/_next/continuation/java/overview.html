        Java programming language was originally developed by Sun Microsystems,
        which was initiated by James Gosling and released in 1995 as core
        component of Sun Microsystems.s Java platform (Java 1.0 [J2SE]).
      </p>
      <p>
        As of December 08 the latest release of the Java Standard Edition is 6
        (J2SE). With the advancement of Java and its wide spread popularity,
        multiple configurations were built to suite various types of platforms.
        Ex: J2EE for Enterprise Applications, J2ME for Mobile Applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sun Microsystems has renamed the new J2 versions as Java SE, Java EE and
        Java ME respectively. Java is guaranteed to be
        <b>Write Once, Run Anywhere</b>
      </p>
      <p>Java is:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Object Oriented :</b> In java everything is an Object. Java can
            be easily extended since it is based on the Object model.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Platform independent:</b> Unlike many other programming languages
            including C and C++ when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into
            platform specific machine, rather into platform independent byte
            code. This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by
            virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Simple :</b>Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you
            understand the basic concept of OOP java would be easy to master.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Secure :</b> With Java's secure feature it enables to develop
            virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication techniques are based
            on public-key encryption.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Architectural- neutral :</b>Java compiler generates an
            architecture-neutral object file format which makes the compiled
            code to be executable on many processors, with the presence Java
            runtime system.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Portable :</b>being architectural neutral and having no
            implementation dependent aspects of the specification makes Java
            portable. Compiler and Java is written in ANSI C with a clean
            portability boundary which is a POSIX subset.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Robust :</b>Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone
            situations by emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and
            runtime checking.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Multi-threaded :</b> With Java's multi-threaded feature it is
            possible to write programs that can do many tasks simultaneously.
            This design feature allows developers to construct smoothly running
            interactive applications.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Interpreted :</b>Java byte code is translated on the fly to
            native machine instructions and is not stored anywhere. The
            development process is more rapid and analytical since the linking
            is an incremental and light weight process.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>High Performance:</b> With the use of Just-In-Time compilers Java
            enables high performance.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Distributed :</b>Java is designed for the distributed environment
            of the internet.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Dynamic :</b> Java is considered to be more dynamic than C or C++
            since it is designed to adapt to an evolving environment. Java
            programs can carry extensive amount of run-time information that can
            be used to verify and resolve accesses to objects on run-time.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>History of Java:</h2>
      <p>
        James Gosling initiated the Java language project in June 1991 for use
        in one of his many set-top box projects. The language, initially called
        Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office, also went by
        the name Green and ended up later renamed as Java, from a list of random
        words.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sun released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1995. It
        promised <b>Write Once, Run Anywhere</b> (WORA), providing no-cost
        run-times on popular platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        On 13 November 2006, Sun released much of Java as free and open source
        software under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).
      </p>
      <p>
        On 8 May 2007 Sun finished the process, making all of Java's core code
        free and open-source, aside from a small portion of code to which Sun
        did not hold the copyright.
      </p>
      <h2>Tools you will need:</h2>
      <p>
        For performing the examples discussed in this tutorial, you will need a
        Pentium 200-MHz computer with a minimum of 64 MB of RAM (128 MB of RAM
        recommended).
      </p>
      <p>You also will need the following softwares:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><p>Linux 7.1 or Windows 95/98/2000/XP operating system.</p></li>
        <li><p>Java JDK 5</p></li>
        <li><p>Microsoft Notepad or any other text editor</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This tutorial will provide the necessary skills to create GUI,
        networking, and Web applications using Java.
      </p>
      <h2>What is Next ?</h2>
      <p>
        Next chapter will guide you to where you can obtain Java and its
        documentation. Finally, it instructs you on how to install Java and
        prepare an environment to develop Java applications.
