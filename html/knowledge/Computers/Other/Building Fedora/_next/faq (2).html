    <h2><a>FAQ</a></h2>

    <a>How do I change the IP Address of the target in the documentation?</a>
    <a>Can I use this to install to a different machine?</a>
    <div class="faa">
      Yes, copy all the bundled files to a machine that you can do a cross file
      replacement (sed, ActiveState Komodo),<br />
      1. Replace the main IP in all the files ($_CURRENT_IP, XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX),
      where the X's represent the desired IP.<br />
      2. Now change the first three octets in all files (192.168.122,
      XXX.XXX.XXX), where the X's represent the desired IP. This will modify
      file records that use just the netmask or the first three octets in
      common, like DNS resource records.<br />

    <a>rootMe55 is not a very good password!</a>
    <div class="faa">
      It is an easy to remember password for setup. You should go through and
      search all files for rootMe55 and change them either in the document or
      mentally so that they are unique to your system.

    <a>What are the color requireds?</a>
    <div class="faa">
      Blue is unread link, purple is a visited link, yellow is a page in
      progress, and red is a future page.
    </div>

    <a>how do I keep track of which steps I have performed?</a>
    <div class="faa">
      There are two ways, one is the color required of the links, they will
      change to purple after you visit them. The other is the /install
      directory, after each step you touch a file that indicates you finished
      the respective step
