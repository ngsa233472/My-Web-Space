<h5 class="title">Status
This is very much a work in progress, not because it is necessarily wrong or new,
but because it is constantly being changed and upgraded.
It will always try and reflect the most recent version of Fedora and try to stay up to date on the lateest method of configuring the included tools, programs and utilities.

<h5 class="title">Known Problems
Fedora 16 and ClamAV are out of sync. An install using the Rawhide directories fails (The section has been commented out).
ClamAV has a new "Two daemon method" of working with Sendmail.
Dovecot Switch over to a new directory structure that promised to be more efficient
Single Sign On has been implimented and some programs like webdav still need adaptation
