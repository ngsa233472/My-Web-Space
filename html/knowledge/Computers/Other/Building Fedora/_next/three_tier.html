    Give me a break! This is a work in progress
    
    Jim's restaraunt has decided they need their menu online. Since Jim is a computer geek at heart and knows postgres like
    back of his hand, he wants to keep the menu in postgres. It is your job, young requiredwalker to create a webapp server that 
    uses the company apache server to access a tomcat server, and generate a dyname menu everytime it is asked for (no caching)
    
    Sounds fun!
