      <p>
        Abstraction refers to the ability to make a class abstract in OOP. An
        abstract class is one that cannot be instantiated. All other
        functionality of the class still exists, and its fields, methods, and
        constructors are all accessed in the same manner. You just cannot create
        an instance of the abstract class.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a class is abstract and cannot be instantiated, the class does not
        have much use unless it is subclassed. This is typically how abstract
        classes come about during the design phase. A parent class contains the
        common functionality of a collection of child classes, but the parent
        class itself is too abstract to be used on its own.
      </p>
      <h2>Abstract Class:</h2>
      <p>
        Use the <b>abstract</b> keyword to declare a class abstract. The keyword
        appears in the class declaration somewhere before the class keyword.
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
/* File name : Employee.java */
public abstract class Employee
{
   private String name;
   private String address;
   private int number;
   public Employee(String name, String address, int number)
   {
      System.out.println("Constructing an Employee");
      this.name = name;
      this.address = address;
      this.number = number;
   }
   public double computePay()
   {
     System.out.println("Inside Employee computePay");
     return 0.0;
   }
   public void mailCheck()
   {
      System.out.println("Mailing a check to " + this.name
       + " " + this.address);
   }
   public String toString()
   {
      return name + " " + address + " " + number;
   }
   public String getName()
   {
      return name;
   }
   public String getAddress()
   {
      return address;
   }
   public void setAddress(String newAddress)
   {
      address = newAddress;
   }
   public int getNumber()
   {
     return number;
   }
}
</pre
      >
      <p>
        Notice that nothing is different in this Employee class. The class is
        now abstract, but it still has three fields, seven methods, and one
        constructor.
      </p>
      <p>Now if you would try as follows:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
/* File name : AbstractDemo.java */
public class AbstractDemo
{
   public static void main(String [] args)
   {
      /* Following is not allowed and would raise error */
      Employee e = new Employee("George W.", "Houston, TX", 43);

      System.out.println("\n Call mailCheck using 
                                   Employee reference--");
      e.mailCheck();
    }
}
</pre
      >
      <p>
        When you would compile above class then you would get following error:
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
Employee.java:46: Employee is abstract; cannot be instantiated
      Employee e = new Employee("George W.", "Houston, TX", 43);
                   ^
1 error
</pre
      >
      <h2>Extending Abstract Class:</h2>
      <p>We can extend Employee class in normal way as follows:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
/* File name : Salary.java */
public class Salary extends Employee
{
   private double salary; //Annual salary
   public Salary(String name, String address, int number, double
      salary)
   {
       super(name, address, number);
       setSalary(salary);
   }
   public void mailCheck()
   {
       System.out.println("Within mailCheck of Salary class ");
       System.out.println("Mailing check to " + getName()
       + " with salary " + salary);
   }
   public double getSalary()
   {
       return salary;
   }
   public void setSalary(double newSalary)
   {
       if(newSalary &gt;= 0.0)
       {
          salary = newSalary;
       }
   }
   public double computePay()
   {
      System.out.println("Computing salary pay for " + getName());
      return salary/52;
   }
}
</pre
      >
      <p>
        Here we cannot instantiate a new Employee, but if we instantiate a new
        Salary object, the Salary object will inherit the three fields and seven
        methods from Employee.
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
/* File name : AbstractDemo.java */
public class AbstractDemo
{
   public static void main(String [] args)
   {
      Salary s = new Salary("Mohd Mohtashim", "Ambehta,  UP",
                                 3, 3600.00);
      Salary e = new Salary("John Adams", "Boston, MA",
                                 2, 2400.00);

      System.out.println("Call mailCheck using
                                   Salary reference --");
      s.mailCheck();
      System.out.println("\n Call mailCheck using
                                   Employee reference--");
      e.mailCheck();
    }
}
</pre
      >
      <p>This would produce following result:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
Constructing an Employee
Constructing an Employee
Call mailCheck using  Salary reference --
Within mailCheck of Salary class
Mailing check to Mohd Mohtashim with salary 3600.0

Call mailCheck using Employee reference--
Within mailCheck of Salary class
Mailing check to John Adams with salary 2400.
</pre
      >
      <h2>Abstract Methods:</h2>
      <p>
        If you want a class to contain a particular method but you want the
        actual implementation of that method to be determined by child classes,
        you can declare the method in the parent class as abstract.
      </p>
      <p>
        The abstract keyword is also used to declare a method as abstract.An
        abstract methods consist of a method signature, but no method body.
      </p>
      <p>
        Abstract method would have no definition, and its signature is followed
        by a semicolon, not curly braces as follows:
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
public abstract class Employee
{
   private String name;
   private String address;
   private int number;
   
   public abstract double computePay();
   
   //Remainder of class definition
}
</pre
      >
      <p>Declaring a method as abstract has two results:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          <p>
            The class must also be declared abstract. If a class contains an
            abstract method, the class must be abstract as well.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Any child class must either override the abstract method or declare
            itself abstract.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A child class that inherits an abstract method must override it. If they
        do not, they must be abstract,and any of their children must override
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, a descendant class has to implement the abstract method;
        otherwise, you would have a hierarchy of abstract classes that cannot be
        instantiated.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Salary is extending Employee class then it is required to implement
        computePay() method as follows:
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
/* File name : Salary.java */
public class Salary extends Employee
{
   private double salary; // Annual salary
  
   public double computePay()
   {
      System.out.println("Computing salary pay for " + getName());
      return salary/52;
   }

   //Remainder of class definition
}
