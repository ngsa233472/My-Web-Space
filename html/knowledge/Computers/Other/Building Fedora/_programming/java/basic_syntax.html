      <p>
        When we consider a Java program it can be defined as a collection of
        objects that communicate via invoking each others methods. Let us now
        briefly look into what do class, object, methods and instant variables
        mean.
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Object -</b> Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog
            has states-color, name, breed as well as behaviors -wagging,
            barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Class -</b> A class can be defined as a template/ blue print that
            describe the behaviors/states that object of its type support.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Methods -</b> A method is basically a behavior. A class can
            contain many methods. It is in methods where the logics are written,
            data is manipulated and all the actions are executed.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Instant Variables -</b> Each object has its unique set of instant
            variables. An object's state is created by the values assigned to
            these instant variables.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>First Java Program:</h2>
      <p>
        Let us look at a simple code that would print the words
        <i>Hello World</i>.
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
public class MyFirstJavaProgram {

   /* This is my first java program.  
    * This will print 'Hello World' as the output
    */

    public static void main(String []args) {
       System.out.println("Hello World"); // prints Hello World
    }
} 
</pre
      >
      <p>
        Lets look at how to save the file, compile and run the program. Please
        follow the steps given below:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><p>Open notepad and add the code as above.</p></li>
        <li><p>Save the file as : MyFirstJavaProgram.java.</p></li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Open a command prompt window and go o the directory where you saved
            the class. Assume its C:\.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Type ' javac MyFirstJavaProgram.java ' and press enter to compile
            your code. If there are no errors in your code the command prompt
            will take you to the next line.( Assumption : The path variable is
            set).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Now type ' java MyFirstJavaProgram ' to run your program.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>You will be able to see ' Hello World ' printed on the window.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
>
C : &gt; javac MyFirstJavaProgram.java
C : &gt; java MyFirstJavaProgram 
Hello World
</pre

      <h2>Basic Syntax:</h2>
      <p>
        About Java programs, it is very important to keep in mind the following
        points.
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Case Sensitivity - </b> Java is case sensitive which means
            identifier <b>Hello</b> and <b>hello</b> would have different
            meaning in Java.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Class Names - </b> For all class names the first letter should be
            in Upper Case. <br /><br />
            If several words are used to form a name of the class each inner
            words first letter should be in Upper Case.<br /><br />
            Example <i>class MyFirstJavaClass </i>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Method Names - </b> All method names should start with a Lower
            Case letter. <br /><br />
            If several words are used to form the name of the method, then each
            inner word's first letter should be in Upper Case.<br /><br />
            Example <i>public void myMethodName()</i>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Program File Name - </b> Name of the program file should exactly
            match the class name. <br /><br />
            When saving the file you should save it using the class name
            (Remember java is case sensitive) and append '.java' to the end of
            the name. (if the file name and the class name do not match your
            program will not compile).<br /><br />
            Example : Assume 'MyFirstJavaProgram' is the class name. Then the
            file should be saved as <i>'MyFirstJavaProgram.java'</i>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>public static void main(String args[]) -</b> java program
            processing starts from the main() method which is a mandatory part
            of every java program..
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Java Identifiers:</h2>
      <p>
        All java components require names. Names used for classes, variables and
        methods are called identifiers.
      </p>
      <p>
        In java there are several points to remember about identifiers. They are
        as follows:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          <p>
            All identifiers should begin with a letter (A to Z or a to z ),
            currency character ($) or an underscore (-).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            After the first character identifiers can have any combination of
            characters.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><p>A key word cannot be used as an identifier.</p></li>
        <li><p>Most importantly identifiers are case sensitive.</p></li>
        <li>
          <p>Examples of legal identifiers:age, $salary, _value, __1_value</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Examples of illegal identifiers : 123abc, -salary</p></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Java Modifiers:</h2>
      <p>
        Like other languages it is possible to modify classes, methods etc by
        using modifiers. There are two categories of modifiers.
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          <p><b>Access Modifiers : </b> defualt, public , protected, private</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Non-access Modifiers : </b> final, abstract, strictfp</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We will be looking into more details about modifiers in the next
        section.
      </p>
      <h2>Java Variables:</h2>
      <p>We would see following type of variables in Java:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Local Variables</li>
        <li>Class Variables (Static Variables)</li>
        <li>Instance Variables (Non static variables)</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Java Arrays:</h2>
      <p>
        Arrays are objects that store multiple variables of the same type.
        However an Array itself is an object on the heap. We will look into how
        to declare, construct and initialize in the upcoming chapters.
      </p>
      <h2>Java Enums:</h2>
      <p>
        Enums were introduced in java 5.0. Enums restrict a variable to have one
        of only a few predefined values. The values in this enumerated list are
        called enums.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the use of enums it is possible to reduce the number of bugs in
        your code.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example if we consider an application for a fresh juice shop it
        would be possible to restrict the glass size to small, medium and Large.
        This would make sure that it would not allow anyone to order any size
        other than the small, medium or large.
      </p>
      <h2>Example:</h2>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
class FreshJuice {

   enum FreshJuiceSize{ SMALL, MEDUIM, LARGE }
   FreshJuiceSize size;
}

public class FreshJuiceTest {

   public static void main(String args[]){
      FreshJuice juice = new FreshJuice();
      juice.size = FreshJuice. FreshJuiceSize.MEDUIM ;
   }
}
</pre
      >
      <p>
        <b>Note:</b> enums can be declared as their own or inside a class.
        Methods, variables, constructors can be defined inside enums as well.
      </p>
      <h2>Java Keywords:</h2>
      <p>
        The following list shows the reserved words in Java. These reserved
        words may not be used as constant or variable or any other identifier
        names.
      </p>
      <table class="src">
        <tr>
          <td>abstract</td>
          <td>assert</td>
          <td>boolean</td>
          <td>break</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>byte</td>
          <td>case</td>
          <td>catch</td>
          <td>char</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>class</td>
          <td>const</td>
          <td>continue</td>
          <td>default</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>do</td>
          <td>double</td>
          <td>else</td>
          <td>enum</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>extends</td>
          <td>final</td>
          <td>finally</td>
          <td>float</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>for</td>
          <td>goto</td>
          <td>if</td>
          <td>implements</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>import</td>
          <td>instanceof</td>
          <td>int</td>
          <td>interface</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>long</td>
          <td>native</td>
          <td>new</td>
          <td>package</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>private</td>
          <td>protected</td>
          <td>public</td>
          <td>return</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>short</td>
          <td>static</td>
          <td>strictfp</td>
          <td>super</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>switch</td>
          <td>synchronized</td>
          <td>this</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>

          <td>transient</td>
          <td>try</td>
          <td>void</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>volatile</td>
          <td>while</td>
          <td></td>
          <td></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h2>Comments in Java</h2>
      <p>
        Java supports single line and multi-line comments very similar to c and
        c++. All characters available inside any comment are ignored by Java
        compiler.
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
public class MyFirstJavaProgram{

   /* This is my first java program.
    * This will print 'Hello World' as the output
    * This is an example of multi-line comments.
    */

    public static void main(String []args){
       // This is an example of single line comment
       /* This is also an example of single line comment. */
       System.out.println("Hello World"); 
    }
} 
</pre
      >
      <h2>Using Blank Lines:</h2>
      <p>
        A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as
        a blank line, and Java totally ignores it.
      </p>
      <h2>Inheritance:</h2>
      <p>
        In java classes can be derived from classes. Basically if you need to
        create a new class and here is already a class that has some of the code
        you require, then it is possible to derive your new class from the
        already existing code.
      </p>
      <p>
        This concept allows you to reuse the fields and methods of the existing
        class with out having to rewrite the code in a new class. In this
        scenario the existing class is called the super class and the derived
        class is called the subclass.
      </p>
      <h2>Interfaces:</h2>
      <p>
        In Java language an interface can be defined as a contract between
        objects on how to communicate with each other. Interfaces play a vital
        role when it comes to the concept of inheritance.
      </p>
      <p>
        An interface defines the methods, a deriving class(subclass) should use.
        But the implementation of the methods is totally up to the subclass.
      </p>
      <h2>What is Next ?</h2>
      <p>
        The next section explains about Objects and classes in Java programming.
        At the end of the session you will be able to get a clear picture as to
        what are objects and what are classes in java.
