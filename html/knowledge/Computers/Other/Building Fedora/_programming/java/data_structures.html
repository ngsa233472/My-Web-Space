      <p>
        The data structures provided by the Java utility package are very
        powerful and perform a wide range of functions. These data structures
        consist of the following interface and classes:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><p>Enumeration</p></li>
        <li><p>BitSet</p></li>
        <li><p>Vector</p></li>
        <li><p>Stack</p></li>
        <li><p>Dictionary</p></li>
        <li><p>Hashtable</p></li>
        <li><p>Properties</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All these classes are now legacy and Java-2 has introduced a new
        framework called Collections Framework which is discussed in next
        tutorial:
      </p>
      <h2>The Enumeration:</h2>
      <p>
        The Enumeration interface isn't itself a data structure, but it is very
        important within the context of other data structures. The Enumeration
        interface defines a means to retrieve successive elements from a data
        structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, Enumeration defines a method called nextElement that is
        used to get the next element in a data structure that contains multiple
        elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        To have more detail about this interface, check
        <a href="/java/java_enumeration_interface.htm">The Enumeration</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>The BitSet</h2>
      <p>
        The BitSet class implements a group of bits, or flags, that can be set
        and cleared individually.
      </p>
      <p>
        This class is very useful in cases where you need to keep up with a set
        of boolean values; you just assign a bit to each value and set or clear
        it as appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
        To have more detail about this class, check
        <a href="/java/java_bitset_class.htm">The BitSet</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>The Vector</h2>
      <p>
        The Vector class is similar to a traditional Java array, except that it
        can grow as necessary to accommodate new elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like an array, elements of a Vector object can be accessed via an index
        into the vector.
      </p>
      <p>
        The nice thing about using the Vector class is that you don't have to
        worry about setting it to a specific size upon creation; it shrinks and
        grows automatically when necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        To have more detail about this class, check
        <a href="/java/java_vector_class.htm">The Vector</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>The Stack</h2>
      <p>
        The Stack class implements a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack of elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can think of a stack literally as a vertical stack of objects; when
        you add a new element, it gets stacked on top of the others.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you pull an element off the stack, it comes off the top. In other
        words, the last element you added to the stack is the first one to come
        back off.
      </p>
      <p>
        To have more detail about this class, check
        <a href="/java/java_stack_class.htm">The Stack</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>The Dictionary</h2>
      <p>
        The Dictionary class is an abstract class that defines a data structure
        for mapping keys to values.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is useful in cases where you want to be able to access data via a
        particular key rather than an integer index.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the Dictionary class is abstract, it provides only the framework
        for a key-mapped data structure rather than a specific implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
        To have more detail about this class, check
        <a href="/java/java_dictionary_class.htm">The Dictionary</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>The Hashtable</h2>
      <p>
        The Hashtable class provides a means of organizing data based on some
        user-defined key structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, in an address list hash table you could store and sort data
        based on a key such as ZIP code rather than on a person's name.
      </p>
      <p>
        The specific meaning of keys in regard to hash tables is totally
        dependent on the usage of the hash table and the data it contains.
      </p>
      <p>
        To have more detail about this class, check
        <a href="/java/java_hashtable_class.htm">The Hashtable</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>The Properties</h2>
      <p>
        Properties is a subclass of Hashtable. It is used to maintain lists of
        values in which the key is a String and the value is also a String.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Properties class is used by many other Java classes. For example, it
        is the type of object returned by System.getProperties( ) when obtaining
        environmental values.
      </p>
      <p>
        To have more detail about this class, check
        <a href="/java/java_properties_class.htm">The Properties</a>.
