      <p>
        Java provides a mechanism, called object serialization where an object
        can be represented as a sequence of bytes that includes the object's
        data as well as information about the object's type and the types of
        data stored in the object.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a serialized object has been written into a file, it can be read
        from the file and deserialized that is, the type information and bytes
        that represent the object and its data can be used to recreate the
        object in memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most impressive is that the entire process is JVM independent, meaning
        an object can be serialized on one platform and deserialized on an
        entirely different platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        Classes <b>ObjectInputStream</b> and <b>ObjectOutputStream</b> are
        high-level streams that contain the methods for serializing and
        deserializing an object.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ObjectOutputStream class contains many write methods for writing
        various data types, but one method in particular stands out:
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
public final void writeObject(Object x) throws IOException
</pre
      >
      <p>
        The above method serializes an Object and sends it to the output stream.
        Similarly, the ObjectInputStream class contains the following method for
        deserializing an object:
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
public final Object readObject() throws IOException, 
                                 ClassNotFoundException
</pre
      >
      <p>
        This method retrieves the next Object out of the stream and deserializes
        it. The return value is Object, so you will need to cast it to its
        appropriate data type.
      </p>
      <p>
        To demonstrate how serialization works in Java, I am going to use the
        Employee class that we discussed early on in the book. Suppose that we
        have the following Employee class, which implements the Serializable
        interface:
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
public class Employee implements java.io.Serializable
{
   public String name;
   public String address;
   public int transient SSN;
   public int number;
   public void mailCheck()
   {
      System.out.println("Mailing a check to " + name
                           + " " + address);
   }
}
</pre
      >
      <p>
        Notice that for a class to be serialized successfully, two conditions
        must be met:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          <p>The class must implement the java.io.Serializable interface.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            All of the fields in the class must be serializable. If a field is
            not serializable, it must be marked transient.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you are curious to know if a Java Satandard Class is serializable or
        not, check the documentation for the class. The test is simple: If the
        class implements java.io.Serializable, then it is serializable;
        otherwise, it's not.
      </p>
      <h2>Serializing an Object:</h2>
      <p>
        The ObjectOutputStream class is used to serialize an Object. The
        following SerializeDemo program instantiates an Employee object and
        serializes it to a file.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the program is done executing, a file named employee.ser is
        created. The program does not generate any output, but study the code
        and try to determine what the program is doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Note:</b> When serializing an object to a file, the standard
        convention in Java is to give the file a <b>.ser</b> extension.
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
import java.io.*;

public class SerializeDemo
{
   public static void main(String [] args)
   {
      Employee e = new Employee();
      e.name = "Reyan Ali";
      e.address = "Phokka Kuan, Ambehta Peer";
      e.SSN = 11122333;
      e.number = 101;
      try
      {
         FileOutputStream fileOut =
         new FileOutputStream("employee.ser");
         ObjectOutputStream out =
                            new ObjectOutputStream(fileOut);
         out.writeObject(e);
         out.close();
          fileOut.close();
      }catch(IOException i)
      {
          i.printStackTrace();
      }
   }
}
</pre
      >
      <h2>Deserializing an Object:</h2>
      <p>
        The following DeserializeDemo program deserializes the Employee object
        created in the SerializeDemo program. Study the program and try to
        determine its output:
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
import java.io.*;
public class DeserializeDemo
{
   public static void main(String [] args)
   {
      Employee e = null;
      try
      {
         FileInputStream fileIn =
                          new FileInputStream("employee.ser");
         ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(fileIn);
         e = (Employee) in.readObject();
         in.close();
         fileIn.close();
      }catch(IOException i)
      {
         i.printStackTrace();
         return;
      }catch(ClassNotFoundException c)
      {
         System.out.println(.Employee class not found.);
         c.printStackTrace();
         return;
      }
      System.out.println("Deserialized Employee...");
      System.out.println("Name: " + e.name);
      System.out.println("Address: " + e.address);
      System.out.println("SSN: " + e.SSN);
      System.out.println("Number: " + e.number);
    }
}
</pre
      >
      <p>This would produce following result:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
Deserialized Employee...
Name: Reyan Ali
Address:Phokka Kuan, Ambehta Peer
SSN: 0
Number:101
</pre
      >
      <p>Here are following important points to be noted:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          <p>
            The try/catch block tries to catch a ClassNotFoundException, which
            is declared by the readObject() method. For a JVM to be able to
            deserialize an object, it must be able to find the bytecode for the
            class. If the JVM can't find a class during the deserialization of
            an object, it throws a ClassNotFoundException.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Notice that the return value of readObject() is cast to an Employee
            reference.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The value of the SSN field was 11122333 when the object was
            serialized, but because the field is transient, this value was not
            sent to the output stream. The SSN field of the deserialized
            Employee object is 0.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
