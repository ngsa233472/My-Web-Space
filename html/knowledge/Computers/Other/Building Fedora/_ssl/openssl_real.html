<h2><a>OpenSSL Configuration using a real CA Cert</a></h2>

<a>a. Download the CA Certificate</a>

<br><br>Anyone who is going to sign your certificate, is going to make a CA Certificicate available to you.
Find this cert and place it in the directory /usr/share/ssl/certs/ naming it CA.crt<br>
<br>

<a>e. Generate a Certificate Signing Request</a>

First we generate an private key

<div class="command">
cd /usr/share/ssl/private &#38;&#38;
/usr/bin/openssl genrsa -out hawaii.efficax.net.key 1024
</div>

Using this key, we generate a Certificate Request (CSR).

<div class="command">
/usr/bin/openssl req -new -key hawaii.efficax.net.key -out hawaii.efficax.net.csr
</div>

<div class="output">
<pre>You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----

Country Name (2 letter code) [GB]: <font color="blue">US</font>
State or Province Name (full name) [Berkshire]: <font color="blue">Texas</font>
Locality Name (eg, city) [Newbury]: <font color="blue">Cedar Park</font>
Organization Name (eg, company) [My Company Ltd]: <font color="blue">Efficax</font>
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:<font color="blue">&lt cr &gt</font>
Common Name (eg, your name or your server's hostname) []: <font color="blue">hawaii.efficax.net</font>

Email Address []: <font color="blue">nagray@austin.rr.com</font>
             
Please enter the following 'extra' attributes
to be sent with your certificate request
A challenge password []:<font color="blue">&lt cr &gt</font>
An optional company name []:<font color="blue">&lt cr &gt</font>
</font>
</pre>
</div>

The key should now be moved to /usr/share/ssl/private and chmoded 0710.<br>
<br>
After you have done this, you will send the CSR to the Certificate Authority. They will return a certificate which you will name hawaii.efficax.net.crt and place in the /usr/share/ssl/certs directory.<br>
</div>

<h4><a>Note this step</a></h4>
<div class="command">
